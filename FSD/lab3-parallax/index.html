            Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the
            game is for a single
            player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, touch out
            as many of
            their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the
            defenders, and
            in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team
            earns a point for
            stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought
            back in for each
            point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.

            It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in
            the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national
            sport of Bangladesh. It is the state game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana,
            Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.

        There are two major disciplines of kabaddi: "Punjabi kabaddi", also referred to as "circle styles", comprises
        traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the "standard style", played on a
        rectangular court indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as
        the Asian Games.

        Although unverified, theories from various sources state that kabaddi originated from the Vedic period of ancient India,
        speculated to being from present day Haryana. The game was said to have been popular among the Yadava people; an
        abhang by Tukaram stated that the lord Krishna played the game in his youth, while the Mahabharata contains an account
        of Arjuna being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies unscathedâ€”a passage said to parallel the gameplay
        of kabaddi. There are also accounts of Gautam Buddha having played the game recreationally.
